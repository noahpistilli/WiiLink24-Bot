# WiiLink24-Bot
This is a bot for the WiiLink24 discord server

#### How to Self-Host

I wouldn't because there are probably better bots out there, but here we go

1. Download the source code
2. Create a Application in the Discord Developer Panel
3. Click on `Bot` and copy the token
4. Type `cd /path/to/WiiLink24-Bot-Master`
5. Create a .env file to store the bot's token
6. Invite the bot to your server from O2Auth
7. Run `python3 wiilink24.py`
8. You win!
